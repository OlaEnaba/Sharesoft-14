<h3> <br> <i> About Me </i> </h3>
<p> <i>The best contribution one can make to humanity is to improve oneself. > Frank Herbert </i>

<br><br>I believe in my imperfections, and I believe they are the reason for my existence. I find opportunities in my failures, flaws, defects and limitations. Without them, I would have never had the chance to become a better person. I believe that the world changes only when you decide to change. Thus, I want to explore and examine my proficiencies and inner power. Exerting effort on something I like, and being devoted to something of a meaning will help me get to know more about the person I am. My objective in life is to constantly and forever become a better person.

	<br><br>Due to this journey, I am now more open minded, more of a risk taker, more well-balanced, and definitely more reflective. I like challenging myself and trying to go an extra mile. I am a deep admirer of gaining knowledge and skills, and I believe that the sky is the limit. I am in continuous search for new experiences and challenges to go through.
